## üì• Installation and Usage

### 1. Environment Setup
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EricTra/OpenCV-FaceRecognition-Database.git
cd OpenCV-FaceRecognition-Database
`````
Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python firebase-admin face-recognition numpy
`````
### 2. Firebase Configuration
- Create a Firebase project on Firebase Console.
- Download the serviceAccountKey.json file and place it in the root directory of the project.
- Update the database URL and storage bucket in the source code (Main.py, AddDataToDatabase.py, etc.) to match your Firebase configuration.
 ### 3. Running the Application
1. Encode facial data and save it to a file:
```bash
python EncodeGenerator.py
`````

2. Add user data to Firebase:
 ```bash
python AddDataToDatabase.py
`````

3. Start the facial recognition system:
```bash
python Main.py
`````
